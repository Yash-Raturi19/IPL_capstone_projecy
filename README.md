🏏 IPL 2022 Capstone Project | Data Visualization & Insights 📊

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is more than just cricket—it’s a data goldmine. In this project, I analyzed IPL 2022 match-level data to uncover meaningful insights around match outcomes, team performance, and player impact.

🔍 Key Focus Areas:
• Match results & winning patterns
• Team performance across venues
• Toss decisions vs match outcomes
• Player contributions & consistency
• Run trends, wickets, and scoring behavior

📈 Using data visualization techniques, I transformed raw IPL data into clear, interactive dashboards that help understand team dynamics and performance trends throughout the season.

This capstone project strengthened my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and storytelling through visuals, proving how data can enhance sports analytics and decision-making.

💡 Turning cricket data into actionable insights!
